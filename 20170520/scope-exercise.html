    // Run this program. Then turn to the person next to you and answer the following questions:
    // 1. What is the difference (in output) between Situation 1 and Situation 2?
    // 2. Why are the alert messages different? (Hint: Look for syntax differences)

    // Situation 1
    // ------------------------------------------
    
    //Global Scope
    var myVar1 = 1;

    //function below is global
    function a1() {

      b1();

    //function below is global
    function b1() {
      alert("Q1 | b: " + myVar1);
    }

    //this is when a1() is executed, NOT above

    // Situation 2
    // ------------------------------------------

    //Local Scope
    var myVar2 = 1;

    //function below is global
    function a2() {

    	//variable below is within function a2(), therefore local scope
      var myVar2 = 5 - 3;

      //this is when b2() is executed
